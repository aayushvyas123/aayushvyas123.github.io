                <p>
                    Joanne Kathleen Rowling is a British writer, screenwriter, producer and philanthropist, born July
                    31, 1965 in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Nwz3RKHUVybCoYXd9">Yate, United Kingdom</a>.
                    She loved to write stories from an early age. She used to write strange stories from childhood and
                    tell them to her sister. Rowling became a big fan of <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jessica+mitford&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN879IN879&oq=jessica+mitford&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.24494j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Jessica

                    autobiography,
                    And she reads
                    all her books.
                </p>



                <p>In 1982, Rowling took the <a

                        University</a> entrance exam, but she wasn't selected.So she was forced
                    to take admission <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tTP1TcwzCqrSDJg9BJMrUgtSS1SKM3LLEstKs4sqQQAlRUKlQ&q=exeter+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN879IN879&oq=exeter+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46j0l3j46l2j69i60.7565j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Exeter
                        University</a>. After graduating from this university, She went to
                    college to
                    study French and graduated in 1986, after which she worked
                    as a secretary in a company called Amnesty International, and later in Manchester, where she
                    also
                    worked at Chamber of
                    Commerce. Her workplace was also very insulting to her.

                </p>


                <p>
                    While she was traveling by train from Manchester to London, the story of a young boy studying in a
                    school of magic came
                    to her mind, And she plotted the whole story in her mind, And when she arrived at her campus in
                    London, she immediately started writing on it.However, her mother, who was closest to rowling, died
                    a few days later.The incident also had an impact on Rowling's writing.
                    And she was drowning in grief. Rowling avoided writing for a while due to this shock.
                </p>



                <p>Then she
                    resorted to writing to forget her grief, And began to spend all her time in writing. After a
                    while she went to Portugal in search of a job, where she got a job teaching English. She worked at
                    night and wrote during the day.In Portugal she met journalist <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN879IN879&sxsrf=ALeKk03cwTqsLbyt2eZN-M7LoF0_-Ymzmg:1595008393208&q=Jorge+Arantes&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3MDGqyFDiArPSsgvTzLUkspOt9AtS8wtyUoFUUXF-nlVxQX5pceoiVl6v_KL0VAXHosS8ktTiHayMAGKl9QNFAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjcosOl7dTqAhULyDgGHTJ0A0YQmxMoAjAtegQIFBAE&biw=1366&bih=695">Jorge
                        Arantes</a>. The two
                    had a lot in
                    common. So they were married on October 16, 1992, and
                    had a daughter, Jessica, on July 27, 1993. But almost 13 months after the marriage, Rowling
                    divorced.
                </p>

                <p>Rowling then moved with her daughter to her sister to live there in Scotland. Until then she had
                    written 3 chapters of Harry Potter. This time was too bad for rowling. Her marriage had failed, she
                    had the responsibility of having a child, and she had no
                    job. She filled out a form for welfare benefits to cover her expenses. Under which the British
                    government paid for the house
                    expenses of poor as well as single parents.

                </p>

                <p>However, despite all these difficulties, she never
                    stopped writing. And finally her first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was
                    completed. However, it took her about 5 years to write this book.She then took it to the publishers
                    to get it published and there too she found failure. 12 The publishing house refused
                    to print her book. But a year later, Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London, agreed to publish the
                    book.
                </p>

                <p>As soon as the book was published on June 26, 1997, it felt like a miracle. This book was very much
                    liked by the people. And this book was soon awarded the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize for 9 to 11
                    years. Then other parts of the Harry Potter novel series began to be published. The fourth novel,
                    Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, launched on July 8, 2000, broke all records.
                    And 372,755 copies of this book were sold in the UK on the first day.
                </p>
                <p>The fifth book in the Harry Potter series was released in 2003, and in 2004 Rowling was the first
                    author to become a
                    billionaire. This was followed by the publication of the seventh and final book on July 21, 2007,
                    which broke all records and became
                    the best-selling books all the time.</p>
